Anidex is a simple yet exciting app that combines the fun of a Pokémon Pokédex with real-life animals. Explore and discover a wide variety of animals, each featuring unique rarity levels and achievements to unlock as you interact with the app.

The app leverages OpenAI’s powerful AI to identify animals uploaded by users, while the comprehensive GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) dataset enriches the animal database with accurate and detailed information.

This project is my personal journey into web development. Along the way, I’ve gained hands-on experience with managing SQL databases and manipulating datasets in Python using Pandas.

On the frontend, I’ve deepened my understanding of React, especially React Hooks, which have been invaluable for building interactive components — and I’m planning to transition the app to React Native soon to enable mobile support.

I also explored Next.js and its API routes, which simplified backend data fetching and improved the overall architecture of the app.

Anidex is both a learning adventure and a fun tool to celebrate biodiversity — blending technology with nature in a playful, educational way.
